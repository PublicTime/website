			<h4><a href='/people.html#terry-ott'>Terry D. Ott</a></h4><p>In 2008, I started PublicNTP as a personal hobby project. Back then, PublicNTP consisted of a small set of cloud-based Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers, all inside the United States, that with the help of hyper-accurate time provided by atomic clocks, provided time references for computers around the world.</p><p>Starting in 2016, PublicNTP added its first NTP servers outside the United States. It quickly became clear that the need to deploy NTP servers in less-developed parts of the world was orders of magnitude more urgent than inside first-world countries such as the US.  Much of the world faces desperately inadequate access to any local network-based time sources--much less high-quality sources.</p><p>At the same time, it became evident that PublicNTP would need to grow bigger and faster than one person could hope to do on their own. I reached out to three decades-long friends and peers, <a href='/people.html#dan-noland'>Dan Noland</a>, <a href='/people.html#brad-woodfin'>Brad Woodfin</a>, and <a href='/people.html#scott-waddell'>Scott Waddell</a>, and invited them to help PublicNTP make the transitions needed to take on a much bigger challenge.</p><p>On July 26, 2017, the Commonwealth of Virginia issued PublicNTP, Inc. its <a href='/documents/certificate_of_incorp.pdf'>certificate of incorporation</a> as a nonstock corporation, with Dan, Brad, Scott, and I serving as the first four directors and officers.</p><p>In early August 2017, the Internal Revenue Service granted PublicNTP, Inc. <a href='/documents/acceptance_letter.pdf'>tax-exempt public charity status</a> (commonly known as a “501(c)(3)” nonprofit corporation).</p><p>As with all IRS-recognized 501(c)(3) public charities, <a href='/donate.html'>charitable contributions</a> to PublicNTP (both cash and noncash) are now tax-deductible to the <a href='https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p526.pdf'>limits allowed by the IRS</a>. Consult your tax advisor regarding how charitable contributions to PublicNTP can benefit your personal financial situation.</p><p>PublicNTP started in 2008 with a single time server in the midwest United States. As of this writing, PublicNTP has deployed servers across 22 cities, 15 countries, and six continents. The newly-gained ability to accept <a href='/donate.html'>charitable donations</a> empowers PublicNTP to deliver on its mission statement of improving unrestricted access to no-cost, highly-accurate time sources in those parts of the world with the most dire shortage of publicly-accessible NTP servers.</p><p>More developed parts of the world often take a robust infrastructure, including access to highly-accurate time references, for granted.  Access to a robust infrastructure reduces the difficulties of making a wide variety of breakthroughs, technological as well as social.</p><p><a href='/donate.html'>Charitable donations</a> will enable PublicNTP to continue its decades-long effort to gradually improve the global IT infrastructure. On behalf of PublicNTP, I hope you’ll consider supporting our efforts!</p>
