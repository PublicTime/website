				<p class="about__p">
					Growing up in Denver, Colorado, I'd often ask my parents if they'd let me call the
					<a href="https://www.nist.gov/pml/time-and-frequency-division/services/telephone-time-day-ttds">NIST Telephone
						Time-of-Day Service</a> in the nearby city of Boulder to hear the current time according to the atomic
					clocks.

			</div>
			<div class="about">
				<p class="about__p">
					During my college years, friends rolled their eyes when they saw me calibrating my wristwatch with the atomic time
					on the
					University central servers. As I became deeply interested in Linux system adminstration, it was a near-certainty
					to
					find an NTP daemon running on any host I had root privs on.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="about">
				<p class="about__p">
					I founded PublicNTP in 2008 based on a deeply-held belief that highly-accurate time data should be provided as an
					unrestricted
					public service, open to all systems on the Internet.

			<div class="about">
				<p class="about__p">
					With a personal goal to contribute by donating time to personally install stratum one servers in portions of the
					world where
					the network has relatively few accurate, reliable, low-latency NTP servers, PublicNTP doubles as an excellent
					opportunity
					for me to travel to relatively-exotic locations‚Äîsomething I enjoy immensely.

				<p class="about__p">
					I‚Äôve always had a passion for solving complex problems, but I‚Äôve never liked to do it the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù way. For 18
					years, I got
					a strong foundation in rigorous discipline as an Officer in the Air National Guard, while simultaneously pursuing
					my
					passion for technology in electrical engineering. Transitioning to the software development process in 2003 was a
					natural
					evolution for me. The digital product space is still the Wild West of technology, a place you can imagine an idea,
					prototype
					it quickly and cheaply, and bring it to market on your own (or at least with a small, tight team). There‚Äôs an
					ethos
					you have to follow, sure, but how you do it isn‚Äôt as important as that you get it done. Currently, I‚Äôm CIO of
					Boncom,
					a digital company I helped build from the ground up, and an author and creator of the Rebellious Learning brand.
					I‚Äôm
					a huge advocate for renegade product makers out to change the world.

					I'm a second generation Computer Scientist, and a third generation Auburn Tiger (some of the other board members

					I
					met Terry and Dan on my first day as a graduate student at Purdue, and the rest is history. For a little more info
					about
					me, my background is heavily skewed towards computer security and low-level programming. I've had the good fortune

					At some point in our storied history, Terry recommended Hackers by Stephen Levy. It does a great job of expressing
					what I
					love about this community, and more importantly the ethos that we should all exhibit. I joined the board because
					Terry
					asked me, and I agreed that it's a really important and generally neglected service. We'd been casually
					participating
					in things by running a box in Chicago, and taking the next logical step seemed like a great idea. After
					interacting
					with the other people involved in the project, it became clear to me very quickly that not getting involved would
					be
					a bad decision. Everyone has the right mindset, the right ethos, and the right goals. We (I am proud to include
					myself)
					are dedicated to providing a critical service that everyone takes for granted.
